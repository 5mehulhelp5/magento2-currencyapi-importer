title: Real Time Currency Api Importer

long description:
This extension for Magento 2 provides real-time currency exchange rates from CurrencyApi.net, ensuring your international customers see accurate pricing in their local currency. The extension automatically updates currency rates via Magento's cron system, eliminating the need for manual rate management. Perfect for e-commerce stores serving global customers, this extension supports 152 currencies. A great alternative to Fixer.io, it offers reliable rate updates with robust error handling and retry logic.

Once installed, the extension connects your Magento store directly to the CurrencyApi.net service to automatically fetch and update exchange rates in real time. This ensures product prices, totals, and checkout amounts stay accurate for international customers without manual intervention. You can choose CurrencyApi.net as your currency import service in the Magento admin, enter your API key, and let the system handle minute, hourly or daily updates through Magento’s built-in cron. The extension fits seamlessly into your existing store setup—no custom code required—and provides transparent logs and error handling so you can easily monitor updates and troubleshoot if needed.
